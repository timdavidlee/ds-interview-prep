Q:Design a Hit-counter

“Design hit counter” problem has recently been asked by many companies including Dropbox and the question is harder than it seems to be. It includes a couple of topics like basic data structures design, various optimization, concurrency and distributed counter.

It should support the following two operations: hit and getHits.


HitCounter counter = new HitCounter();

// hit at timestamp 1.
counter.hit(1);

// hit at timestamp 2.
counter.hit(2);

// hit at timestamp 3.
counter.hit(3);

// get hits at timestamp 4, should return 3.
counter.getHits(4);

// hit at timestamp 300.
counter.hit(300);

// get hits at timestamp 300, should return 4.
counter.getHits(300);

// get hits at timestamp 301, should return 3.
counter.getHits(301);
